ame
===

Ame is a simplified AngularJS, MongoDB and Express App skeleton for modern html5 projects. 


reduced from yeoman's angular full stack generator, Ame DOES NOT include

- jQuery
  - jQuery is nice, but it's just not the angular way of doing things 
- bootstrap.js
  - requires jQuery to work
- img/html min
  - premature optimization is the root of all evil? plus image lib does not work well in windows 
- bcrypt
  - requires python to run. Py-what?
- ejs
  - use jade generated html instead, serve static html directly instead of from server middleware
